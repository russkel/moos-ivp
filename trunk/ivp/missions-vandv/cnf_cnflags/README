The CNF group confirms many variants of contact flags and relative position triggers.

<tag><group-synopsis>
The CNF group is a set of tests confirming the function of "contact
flags". A contact flag is specified using the cnflag parameter. A flag
is a MOOS variable and value pair.  The cnflags are defined at the
IvPContactBehavior superclass, so they are available to all contact
behaviors, including BHV_AvoidCollision, BHV_AvdColregs19, BHV_Trail
and so on. The flags have a variety of triggers. A trigger is based on
the relative position between ownship and the contact. For example the
"@cpa" trigger, when associated with a contact flag, will result in
the flag being published when the two vessels have reached their
CPA. This mission folder sets up a number of variations that confirm
the proper function of contact flags and various triggers.
