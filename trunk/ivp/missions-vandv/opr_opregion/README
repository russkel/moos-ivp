#  A mission README file contains information about this mission, in a format
#  readable by shell scripts that launch mission variations and build reports.
#  
#  All lines beginning with '#' are comments.
#  
#  Various blocks beginning with <tag><tagname> are structured blocks of text
#  in a format consistent across all missions. The tag lines should remain on
#  their own line.
#  
#  Additional tag blocks may be added. They will not interfer w/ existing blocks.

The OPR group tests the basic set of functions of the OpRegion behavior

<tag><group-synopsis>
The CNF group is a set of tests confirming the function of the OpRegion
behavior. This behavior monitors several aspects of the mission and will
post a BHV_ERROR message if it detects a violation of constraints. Such
a posting normally results in an immediate all-stop of the vessel. This
group tests the various constraint modes including the constraint of
remaining within a prescribed convex polygon operation area, and overall
mission time-out, among others.
