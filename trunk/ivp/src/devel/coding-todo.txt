pRealm/ GUIs
================================================
For pMarineViewer (and uMACView) should we have just one set of browser
widgets? Rather than two sets and hiding and showing?

pRealm needs to handle custom watch lists

pRealm should produce an "All Variables" channel, perhaps split into multiple?

Should be able to mask out certain processes with a one-liner in pRealm Config block

History channels?

** Numerical history channels with specialized PMV pane for plotting the data
live.
