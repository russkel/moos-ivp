The mlaunch script produces ~/.mission_launch log file. A multi-line log of
things during the most recent launch.

Launch: mission: vehicle: Date:
line1
line2
....
lineN

Then build uLaunchLog MOOS app that retrieves the lines from the latest
launch for that vehicle. Appcast report shows the launch log. Any warnings
could be propagated up to appcast warnings. Perhaps uLaunchLog would lok for
keywords in the launch log like "Warning: foobar" 


Each behavior produces:
 VOI_STAT  - A one liner suitable for a watchcast multi-line display
 VOI_INFO  - A multi-line appcast like stream that can be viewed as
             a pRealm channel, showing latest 20 publications. pRealm
	     when configured with this channel, will subscribe to this
	     variable at startup to ensure it gets all early postings

 WPT_STAT
 WPT_INFO

 Not sure how or whether to handle multi-instance behaviors
