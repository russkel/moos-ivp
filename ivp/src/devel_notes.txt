BHV_DEBUG
 - a standard variable to publish debug output
 - Possibly add to the HelmPlot window in alogview
 - IvPBehavior::postDebug(string);

o Does the reflector refuse to create an IPF if there were warnings?

o Refinery benchmark plan

 (A) Build a test to compare piece savings 
 (B) Build a test to ensure correctness of refineries

o uFldNodeBroker should show a config warning if started without a tryhost

o OF_Reflector: In the first stage, uniform pieces are still built, even though
  many of them will be replaced by plateaus generated by refineries. However, 
  during this first phase, the pieces do not have their interior functions calculated.
  The calculation is the relatively expensive part. This is defered until later
  when potentially refineries have had a chance to generate plateaus, replacing
  originally built pieces.

---------------------
o added to AOF superclass the virtual functions minMaxKnown, getKnownMin etc
  to support testing utilites for refineries. We'll want to auto-detect pieces
  in PDMaps that have zero slope, and const value equiv to either min/max. And
  then check the content of those pieces to see if each point does indeed eval
  to either min/max. To verify that our refineries don't over step their bounds.

---------------------
Started to make m_verbose in all the RT_* classes in IvPBuild. Also m_verbose
in the reflector class. cout output is potentially useful in the benchmark
utilities. Otherwise off by default.
