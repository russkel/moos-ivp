alogview
===============================================
Fixed a bug in alogview affecting the construction of the collective
objective function to be rendered. Previously it was not properly 
applying the weights of each function.

alogscan
===============================================
Fixed a bug in alogscan that would result in a segfault just prior
to early exit on detected invalid input file. For example an empty
alog file.

pEchoVar
===============================================

o Added Boolean Switching. For a configuration "Echo = FOO !-> BAR",
  if a string representing a Boolean value is published to FOO, a
  string representing the opposite Boolean value is published to
  BAR. The case of the strings is matched.


BHV_AvoidColregsV17
===============================================
o Turned off debugging output inadvertantly left enabled.


uFldCollisionDetect Documentation
===============================================
o substantial additions and corrections

 
pMarineViewer
===============================================

o Added functionality to the Commander pop-up window including
  auto-adjusting button widths, and the ability to add color to a
  button to make it easier for an operator to find and hit an
  emergency button.

o Updated the pMarineViewer documentation to describe commander
  pop-up window functionality. The commander pop-up window feature
  was part of the 17.7 release but was not documented at all.

o The m2_berta mission has been updated to include a non-trivial
  example of the commander pop-up window, to control deploying,
  returning, station-keeping, vehicle speed, and loiter direction
  for both vehicles.

o Improved the drawing efficiency of hash marks (grid lines). New
  version reduces overall CPU load by more than half. 


pHelmIvP
===============================================
o Lazy behavior evaluation (TBD)


pBasicContactManager
===============================================
o Added the ability to have alerts based on a polygon regions, so
  missions can be configured to trigger action if a contact of 
  interest enters a given region. Region criteria can be used 
  in conjunction with range criteria, or simply on its own.
o Added an optional publication of the range to the closest contact.
  Posting turned on with the post_closest_range=true paramater, and
  will publish to CONTACT_RANGE an integer value of the range.
  Value will be published only when the range changes.


o ToDo: ignore contacts from different teams
        buffer value to avoid thrashing
