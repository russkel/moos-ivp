alogview
===============================================
Fixed a bug in alogview affecting the construction of the collective
objective function to be rendered. Previously it was not properly 
applying the weights of each function.

alogscan
===============================================
Fixed a bug in alogscan that would result in a segfault just prior
to early exit on detected invalid input file. For example an empty
alog file.

pEchoVar
===============================================
o Added Boolean Switching. For a configuration "Echo = FOO !-> BAR",
  if a string representing a Boolean value is published to FOO, a
  string representing the opposite Boolean value is published to
  BAR. The case of the strings is matched.

uFldNodeComms
===============================================
o Fixed a bug where some messages were occasionally being dropped 
  despite meeting all the communications criteria.


BHV_AvoidColregsV17
===============================================
o Turned off debugging output inadvertantly left enabled.

BHV_Waypoint
===============================================
o Added lead_condition to allow the user to specify a logic condition
  that must be met in order for the trackline following to be enabled.
  This allows for coordination with any collision avoidance behavior 
  temporarily turn off trackline following during an avoidance encounter.


uFldCollisionDetect Documentation
===============================================
o substantial additions and corrections

 
pMarineViewer
===============================================

o Added functionality to the Commander pop-up window including
  auto-adjusting button widths, and the ability to add color to a
  button to make it easier for an operator to find and hit an
  emergency button.

o Updated the pMarineViewer documentation to describe commander
  pop-up window functionality. The commander pop-up window feature
  was part of the 17.7 release but was not documented at all.

o The m2_berta mission has been updated to include a non-trivial
  example of the commander pop-up window, to control deploying,
  returning, station-keeping, vehicle speed, and loiter direction
  for both vehicles.

o Improved the drawing efficiency of hash marks (grid lines). New
  version reduces overall CPU load by more than half. 


pHelmIvP
===============================================
o Lazy behavior evaluation (TBD)


pBasicContactManager
===============================================
o Added the ability to have alerts based on a polygon regions, so
  missions can be configured to trigger action if a contact of 
  interest enters a given region. Region criteria can be used 
  in conjunction with range criteria, or simply on its own.

o Added an optional publication of the range to the closest contact.
  Posting turned on with the post_closest_range=true paramater, and
  will publish to CONTACT_RANGE an integer value of the range.
  Value will be published only when the range changes.

o Added the contact_max_age_history parameter to guard against 
  unbounded memory growth if the system is producing many unique
  contact IDs over a long period of time.

o ToDo: ignore contacts from different teams
        buffer value to avoid thrashing
